Hi there!

WHAT NOW:

You are installing GNU Common Lisp for Windows, 2.6.1
This compiler depends on Mingw32 GCC (see below).

DO NOT INSTALL INTO A DIRECTORY WITH SPACES IN THE NAME.


MINGW32 GCC:

The MinGW compiler is provided under the terms of the files:

 "COPYING" and "COPYING.LIB"

which are located in the mingw sub-directory.  The source 
code and updated binary packages can be obtained via the 
official MinGW web site:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

It is recommended that you use the compiler provided
when working with this GCL package to ensure C compiler
compatibility.  

Clean and rebuild pre-existing projects whenever you
upgrade the GCL binary package for this reason.
